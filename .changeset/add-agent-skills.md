Add agent skills for coding assistants working with durable-streams. Includes two skills:

- `durable-streams`: Core streaming concepts, APIs (`stream()`, `DurableStream`, `IdempotentProducer`), offset semantics, and common mistakes
- `durable-state`: State synchronization with `MaterializedState`, `StreamDB`, typed collections, and TanStack DB reactive queries
